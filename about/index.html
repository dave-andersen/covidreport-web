    <div class="content">
        <p>This is a competely unofficial compilation of data from
the PA Department of Health, the Allegheny County Department of
Health, the Western PA Regional Datacenter, and the CDC. The
author has no affiliation with any of the data sources,
and no financial interest in anything covid-related.</p>
<p>As I note on my <a href="http://twitter.com/dave_andersen">twitter account
where all this started</a>, I (David Andersen) am neither a virologist,
epidemiologist, or medical professional. So I do encourage you to
let me know if anything I say conflicts with what you're hearing from
experts, and trust them first and foremost.</p>
<p>Why <i>do</i> I feel qualified to do this, then? I do have a background
in biology, with a BS in biology and having spent a small part of my Ph.D.
working on computational biology. As a computer science professor,
I spend a lot of time on data analysis.</p>
<p>Why you might find value in these reports: I try to integrate what we're
hearing from experts with a lot of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh-specific
data analysis, because understanding the quirks of the local data and
situation is helpful in making sense of it. Every covid data source
has its quirks (unfortunately), and context does matter.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dave-andersen/covidreport">code that puts the reports together</a> is open source, written in Rust (mostly for fun, it
probably would have been easier in Python).</p>
